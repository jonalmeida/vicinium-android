# Vicinium (Android client)

Vicinium is micro location-based real-time chat application that lets you have conversations with people in your local area. Using the Firebase API and your GPS location from your Android smartphone, we put people that are in a specific area into a conversation with the people around them. If they were to move away from that area, they would join the conversation in that new location.

There's a huge potential for this application in a social aspect: having local conversations at such a small radius, you can have anonymous conversations with people in an area that is crowded.

Imagine a classroom full of students, if you have a question that you want to ask someone in the class. You can post a message that would only be seen by people in the classroom. 

When you're in a crowded social location (e.g. a hackathon), you find out there's free Redbull on the second floor. You can post an update in the area so that anyone in the vicinity will find out about it when they check out the conversation in Vicinium. Sponsors could send out messages about the free stickers they're giving away at their desk only if you mention the "secret word" that they posted in the chat. These are few applications of a micro location-based chat application.
